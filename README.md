# Title

Card Game Application - TBD

# Project description

<p> In this project we want to create a card playing game application that will present the user with two game options. the API's we want to use: one creates the cards themselves which we will then have to program the game rules. The second API will create and/or pull images to apply to the back of the cards.

The two games will be War and 21.</p>
